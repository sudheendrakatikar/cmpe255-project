The title of our dataset is ‘Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes’. It consists of information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC over the period of 2012-2021, and has over 1.8 million records. The data is very informative since it's generated from a police report template that is quite comprehensive. The dataset was downloaded from https://data.cityofnewyork.us and can be found at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95.

We will try to answer some questions that arise out of reviewing the data, and possibly conduct some prescriptive analysis 
- Are certain localities more prone to accidents than others?
- Do certain vehicles tend to have a recurring cause for the accident?
- Does a street get particularly busy during any hour of the day?
